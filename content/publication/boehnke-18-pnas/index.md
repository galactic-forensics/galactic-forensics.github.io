abstract: "To understand early Earthâ€™s habitability, we need to know when the continental crust first formed. However, due to the combined actions of plate tectonics and erosion, most of the evidence of the early crust has been destroyed. To shed light on this debate, we analyzed the strontium isotopic composition of apatite inclusions in zircons from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, where independent evidence suggests a crust-forming event prior to 4.2 Ga, possibly as early as 4.4 Ga. Our results show that this early crust had a high Rb/Sr ratio and therefore a high silica content. This suggests that the early Earth was capable of forming continental crust within <350 million y of solar system formation."
