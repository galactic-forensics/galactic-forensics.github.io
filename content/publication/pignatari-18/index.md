abstract: "Carbon-rich presolar grains are found in primitive meteorites, with isotopic measurements to date suggesting a core-collapse supernovae origin site for some of them. This holds for about 1–2% of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) grains, so-called Type X and C grains, and about 30% of presolar graphite grains. Presolar SiC grains of Type X show anomalous isotopic signatures for several elements heavier than iron compared to the solar abundances: most notably for strontium, zirconium, molybdenum, ruthenium and barium. We study the nucleosynthesis of zirconium and molybdenum isotopes in the He-shell of three core-collapse supernovae models of 15, 20 and 25 *M*<sub>⊙</sub> with solar metallicity, and compare the results to measurements of presolar grains. We find the stellar models show a large scatter of isotopic abundances for zirconium and molybdenum, but the mass averaged abundances are qualitatively similar to the measurements. We find all models show an excess of <sup>96</sup>Zr relative to the measurements, but the model abundances are affected by the fractionation between Sr and Zr since a large contribution to <sup>90</sup>Zr is due to the radiogenic decay of <sup>90</sup>Sr. Some supernova models show excesses of <sup>95,97</sup>Mo and depletion of <sup>96</sup>Mo relative to solar. The mass averaged distribution from these models shows an excess of <sup>100</sup>Mo, but this may be alleviated by very recent neutron-capture cross section measurements. We encourage future explorations to assess the impact of the uncertainties in key neutron-capture reaction rates that lie along the *n*-process path."
