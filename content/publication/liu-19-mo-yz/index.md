abstract: "We report Mo isotopic compositions of 37 presolar SiC grains of types Y (19) and Z (18), rare types commonly argued to have formed in lower-than-solar metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Direct comparison of the Y and Z grain data with data for mainstream grains from AGB stars of close-to-solar metallicity demonstrates that the three types of grains have indistinguishable Mo isotopic compositions. We show that the Mo isotope data can be used to constrain the maximum stellar temperatures (*T*<sub>MAX</sub>) during thermal pulses in AGB stars. Comparison of FRUITY Torino AGB nucleosynthesis model calculations with the grain data for Mo isotopes points to an origin from low-mass (~1.5–3 *M*<sub>⊙</sub>) rather than intermediate-mass (>3–~9 *M*<sub>⊙</sub>) AGB stars. Because of the low efficiency of <sup>22</sup>Ne(α, n)<sup>25</sup>Mg at the low *T*<sub>MAX</sub> values attained in low-mass AGB stars, model calculations cannot explain the large <sup>30</sup>Si excesses of Z grains as arising from neutron capture, so these excesses remain a puzzle at the moment."
