abstract: "We report Mo isotopic data of 27 new presolar SiC grains, including 12 <sup>14</sup>N-rich AB (<sup>14</sup>N/<sup>15</sup>N > 440, AB2) and 15 mainstream (MS) grains, and their correlated Sr and Ba isotope ratios when available. Direct comparison of the data for the MS grains, which came from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with large *s*-process isotope enhancements, with the AB2 grain data demonstrates that AB2 grains show near-solar isotopic compositions and lack *s*-process enhancements. The near-normal Sr, Mo, and Ba isotopic compositions of AB2 grains clearly exclude born-again AGB stars, where the intermediate neutron-capture process (*i*-process) takes place, as their stellar source. On the other hand, low-mass CO novae and early R- and J-type carbon stars show <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>N excesses but no *s*-process enhancements and are thus potential stellar sources of AB2 grains. Because both early R-type carbon stars and CO novae are rare objects, the abundant J-type carbon stars (10%â€“15% of all carbon stars) are thus likely to be a dominant source of AB2 grains."
