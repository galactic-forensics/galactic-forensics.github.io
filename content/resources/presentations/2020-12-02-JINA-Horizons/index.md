This brief presentation reviews some recent highlights of stardust research
and how it can be used to better understand astrophysical processes such as
the slow neutron capture process and the formation of proton- and neutron-rich 
nuclides. Finally, the presentation discusses future opportunities with stardust
and how these measurements could help to further our knowledge of 
galactic chemical evolution.

The talk was presented at the virtual 2020 JINA Horizons Meeting.
