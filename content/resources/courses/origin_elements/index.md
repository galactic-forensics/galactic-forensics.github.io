The Big Bang only formed hydrogen and helium. All other elements,
e.g., the ones we are made of,
were subsequently formed in stars. This course discusses how these elements 
formed and how we can directly measure and probe nucleosynthesis and galactic
chemical evolution. 
The course starts with the solar composition, i.e.,
the composition of the Solar System that we are ultimately trying to explain.
It then goes back to the Big Bang to start with the first nucleosynthesis events.
From here on, the course loops through various stellar nucleosynthesis events
and discusses observations and measurements along the way that help us
to understand how the elements we are all made of formed in the first place.

This course was first held at Brandeis University in Spring 2021
and is geared as an elective course towards advanced undergraduates and
early graduate students. The course is design as a mixture between 
lectures and reading / discussion of original scientific manuscripts.
