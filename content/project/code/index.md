Research should preferentially consist of new and unique tasks. Computers on the other hand are ideally suited for repetitive tasks. Furthermore, in order to build and run an instrument such as [LION or CHILI](/research/04-rims) control software is required. I have worked and am currently working on multiple code development projects. Most of these projects that are of general interest can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/trappitsch" target="_blank">github profile</a>. Below I will outline a few projects that might be of general interest.

<a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">![Python Logo](/img/projects/code/python_logo.png)</a>

As you will notice, my programming language of choice is python. Please feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you are interested in some code I wrote, want to contribute, collaborate, or you want like to discuss resources for getting started with scientific coding in python.

## iniabu

Iniabu is a package for python that you can use to easily calculate the inital abundances of the solar system and return ratios as Î´-values or in bracket notation. By default the initial abundances from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88055-4_34" target="_blank">Lodders et al. (2009)</a> are called. You can install this module by simply calling:

    pip install iniabu

Help on how to use it can either be found in the <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/iniabu" target="_blank">readme file on github</a> or by accessing the docstring, e.g., from within ipython by calling:

    import iniabu                                                           
    ini = iniabu.IniAbu()                                                   
    ini?

## InstrumentKit

The freely available <a href="https://github.com/Galvant/InstrumentKit" target="_blank">InstrumentKit</a> has been used to interact with hardware for the LION instrument. Several classes have been contributed to this excellent compilation of tools, such that they can be used by other groups as well.


## Mahon Fitting

In order to fit a linear regression we use the routine by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00206819709465336" target="_blank">Mahon (1996)</a>, also known as the "New York" regression, should be used. Along with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aabba9" target="_blank">Trappitsch et al. (2018)</a> publication we published a tool to easily apply the Mahon fitting routine to any dataset. The tool, including a detailed readme file, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/MahonFitting" target="_blank">the respective github site</a>.
