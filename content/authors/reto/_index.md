Early on in life, Reto was always fascinated by the stars. First with a small 6" Newton type reflector,
then with an 11" Cassegrain type one he observed planets, galaxies, and grew his fascination for
Astronomy. After high school, Reto went to the <a href="https://www.unibe.ch" target="_blank">University of Bern</a>
in Switzerland and received first his BSc in Physics with Astronomy in 2008 and then his 
MSc in Physics in 2010. He then moved to the University of Chicago, from where he received his PhD
in 2016 for his thesis entitled: “Deciphering Galactic Chemical Evolution: Iron and Nickel Isotopes 
and Cosmic Ray Exposure Ages of Presolar Silicon Carbide Grains”. During his PhD he helped build the
CHILI Resonance Ionization Instrumet at the University of Chicago. 

After his PhD, Reto moved to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a PostDoc and worked
on the LION Resonance Ionization Instrument. He became a staff scientist in December 2019.
In October 2020 he joined the <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/index.html" target="_blank">Physics Department</a>
at <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu" target="_blank">Brandeis University</a> as a research assistant professor.
